# Support Guide 



As support, you will be helping out in various ways. Helping newcomers will be the largest part. You must be welcoming and ready to answer any questions they may have. Other things include command help, plugin support and permission setup. 

- Support rank does not have punishment permissions. If a player is violating rules, immediately find a moderator to deal with it via slack. Please provide proof if possible.
(Refer to rules on the rule page) 

- Support is the building ground for future moderators. Do a good job and we may consider you. Asking for mod will result in instant promotion denial.

- Always be on slack when logged into the server and check it regularly for announcements. Slack is available for phones. 

- Being active is crucial. It’s okay to take breaks but try to be on during peak times. Weekends are crazy. Inactive Support members will be considered for demotion.

- Having a deep understanding of the mchost plugins is crucial for this role. Most questions will evolve around plugin support. I encourage you guys to tinker around and gain as much knowledge about them as possible.

- If you have any issues with other players/staff or any other questions please contact me in slack.
