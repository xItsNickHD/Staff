# Code of Conduct

Like any organization, Mchost will have a code of conduct for our staff members to follow. We expect that the below rules will be followed by every staff member. Mchost is continuing to grow and we have no time and patience deal with mishaps. We want the server to continue to flourish.

**1. Customer Service**

Players come first! You must respect and provide equal care/support to every player. Past wrongdoings or issues will not affect how you interactive with players. Favoritism and one-sidedness will not be tolerated.

Do not turn down any questions. It is your responsibility to make sure questions are answered. If you're incapable of answering a question, find someone who can. Such as an Admin or Moderator.

**2. Accountability**

As Mchost begins to emerge as an organization we want to stay organized. Accountability of staff must be implemented. This means that you must take full responsibility for your actions.

Any actions that a staff member makes must be justified, mature and responsible.

All bans must be recorded in the 'mod' channel and must have a valid reason. Any bans not recorded will be found out.

Any issues that you may have towards another staff member or player must be reported to Lokeys. Do not attempt to make the situation worse.
